	description "The Space Shuttle was a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system operated from 1981 to 2011 by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as part of the Space Shuttle program.  Even though it has been 1000 years since the original Space Shuttle was in service, the design has seen a resurgence in recent years."
	description "	Some random history nerd at Betelgeuse Shipyards snuck this design into a competition for a Light Freighter as an in-joke with some buddies.  After his design was chosen, much to the prankster's surprise, he was forced to redesign a ship nearly 1000 years old to meet the ambitious proposal he had submitted.  To his credit, he did a decent job of it."
